    "*   **üìä Comprehensive and Structured Performance Evaluation (Structured Output):** Generates detailed, structured reports using Gemini's controlled generation capabilities, objectively assessing technical proficiency, problem-solving methodology, communication clarity, and code quality.\n",
    "*   **üìö Personalized Learning and Skill Enhancement (Grounding):** Employs Gemini's grounding capabilities (integrating with external knowledge sources) to analyze the interview performance and generate a targeted learning plan with relevant resources, directly addressing identified weaknesses.\n",
    "*   **üß† Contextual Awareness and Long-Term Analysis (Long Context Window):** Leverages Gemini's long context window to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the entire interview conversation, enabling nuanced feedback and holistic performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Innovation & Use Case Suitability ‚ú®\n",
    "This project represents a significant step forward in technical interview preparation through its creative and impactful application of Generative AI.\n",
    "*   **üåü Novelty:** It goes beyond simple Q&A by constructing a sophisticated, stateful interviewing agent capable of understanding multimodal input, providing adaptive guidance, and generating nuanced evaluations ‚Äì a level of interaction previously only achievable with human interviewers. The integration of whiteboard understanding directly into a technical interview simulation is particularly novel.\n",
    "*   **üöÄ Impact:** This platform has the potential to democratize access to high-quality interview practice, enabling a wider range of candidates to prepare effectively, reduce interview anxiety, and ultimately improve their chances of success in the competitive tech job market. Its scalability allows for widespread adoption and consistent, objective feedback.\n",
    "*   **üíØ GenAI Suitability:** The project's core functionalities are exceptionally well-suited to the strengths of modern GenAI models like Gemini:\n",
    "    *   **üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Understanding and Generation:** Crucial for engaging in a realistic dialogue, interpreting candidate responses, and formulating insightful questions and feedback.\n",
    "    *   **üíª Code Understanding and Generation:** Essential for interacting with code snippets provided by the candidate and even generating follow-up questions based on the code.\n",
    "    *   **üñºÔ∏è Image Understanding:** Enables the innovative feature of interpreting whiteboard sketches, a common element in real technical interviews.\n",
    "    *   **üìë Structured Output and Function Calling:** Allows for the systematic retrieval of questions and the generation of organized and informative performance reports.\n",
    "    *   **ü§ñ Agentic Capabilities (LangGraph):** Necessary for orchestrating the complex, multi-step process of a technical interview, managing state, and directing the flow of the conversation.\n",
    "    *   **‚è≥ Long Context Window:** Enables the AI to maintain context throughout the interview for more accurate and relevant feedback.\n",
    "    *   **üåç Grounding:** Facilitates the generation of personalized and actionable learning plans based on external knowledge.\n",

    "The heart of this application is the agent built using LangGraph, designed to simulate the flow and logic of a technical interview. LangGraph allows us to define a state machine or graph where nodes represent processing steps (like invoking the LLM or tools) and edges represent the flow between these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Agent Prompts üîë‚û°Ô∏èü§ñ\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are crucial for guiding the Gemini model's behavior. We define several key prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`INTERVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT`:** This is the main prompt defining the AI's persona and core responsibilities.\n",
    "    *   **Persona:** A supportive technical interviewer from \"Mock Technologie Inc.\"\n",
    "    *   **Goal:** Evaluate the candidate's skills while guiding them through a problem.\n",
    "    *   **Behavior:** Ask probing questions, provide *graduated hints* (Level 1-3), encourage \"thinking out loud,\" confirm understanding.\n",
    "    *   **Constraints:** Must use tools to get questions, cannot make up questions, needs confirmation for starting/ending the interview.\n",
    "    *   **Multi-Modal Handling:** Explicit instructions on how to analyze and integrate information from whiteboard screenshots seamlessly into the conversation.\n",
    "    *   **Few-Shot Examples:** Includes example interactions to demonstrate desired behavior, especially regarding hint provision and whiteboard analysis.\n",
    "*   **`WELCOME_MSG`:** The initial message the interviewer presents to the user.\n",
    "*   **`CANDIDATE_EVALUATION_PROMPT`:** Used *after* the interview ends. It instructs a separate LLM call to analyze the full transcript and final code, evaluating the candidate based on specific criteria (Technical Competence, Problem-Solving, Communication). Crucially, it requests the output in a **structured JSON format**.\n",
    "*   **`RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT`:** Used to generate the personalized learning plan. It provides context (interview question, evaluation summary, topics to learn) and instructs the LLM to use the **Google Search tool (Grounding)** to find relevant resources and synthesize recommendations, *without* explicitly listing URLs in the text (citations are handled automatically).\n",
    "*   **`DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT`:** A specialized prompt used by the `get_interview_transcript` utility function. When a whiteboard image is present in the user's message, this prompt asks Gemini to describe the image's content and relevance to the ongoing conversation, making the transcript more comprehensive for the final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it solves the problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **üò¨ Lack of Realistic Simulation:** The `INTERVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is the foundation of realism. It defines the AI's persona, its pedagogical goals (guiding, not just evaluating), its conversational style (probing questions, graduated hints), and how it should handle multi-modal input like whiteboard sketches. Few-shot examples within the prompt explicitly train the AI on how to interact realistically. The `WELCOME_MSG` sets a professional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Subjective/Delayed Feedback:** The `CANDIDATE_EVALUATION_PROMPT` sets clear, predefined criteria for evaluation, making the feedback inherently less subjective than varied human opinions. It guides the LLM to focus on specific, observable behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **üß≠ Difficulty Identifying Weaknesses:** The evaluation prompt specifically requests identification of strengths and weaknesses with evidence. The `RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT` guides the generation of a learning plan directly targeting these identified weaknesses."

    "*   **Problem Definition Confirmation:** Ensure the candidate understands the problem statement completely. Ask them to reiterate the problem in their own words. \"So, just to confirm, can you please explain the problem and expected inputs/outputs back to me?\"\n",
    "*   **Clarifying Questions:** Encourage the candidate to ask clarifying questions before they start coding. \"What questions do you have about the requirements or constraints before we begin?\"\n",
    "*   **Observing and Listening:** Pay close attention to the candidate's thought process.\n",
    "*   **Prompting Explanation:**  Actively ask the candidate to \"think out loud.\" Use prompts like:\n",

    "    *   \"What's your next step?\"\n",
    "    *   \"Why did you choose that approach?\"\n",
    "    *   \"What are the potential trade-offs of this approach?\"\n",
    "*   **Code Implementation:** Ask the candidate to code his solution when he described it in words. If candidate first decided to try bruteforce approach, you should still ask him to code it.\n",
    "*   **Strategic Hint Provision:** Offer hints in a graduated manner:\n",
    "    *   **Level 1 (General):** \"Have you considered [data structure/algorithm]?\", \"What's the time complexity of your current approach?\", \"Are there any edge cases you haven't accounted for?\"\n",

    "    *   **Level 3 (Code Snippet/Conceptual Reminder):** \"In [language], you could use [built-in function] to [achieve specific task].\" \"Remember that Depth First Search involves exploring as far as possible down each branch.\"  Use code snippets SPARINGLY and ONLY after exhausting other options. Focus on conceptual understanding, not direct code completion.\n",

    "Several helper functions support the agent's operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `encode64_pil_image`: Converts PIL Images (from Gradio Sketchpad) to base64 strings suitable for inclusion in Gemini API calls.\n",
    "*   `get_data_for_search`: Extracts structured analysis and learning topics from the evaluation output to feed into the grounding prompt.\n",
    "*   `get_interview_transcript`: Processes the message history (`InterviewState['messages']`), extracting text and code. If an image is present, it calls Gemini using `DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT` to get a text description and incorporates it, creating a comprehensive transcript for the final evaluation. This handles the **long context** aspect.\n",
    "*   `get_learning_resources`: Implements the **Grounding** feature. It calls Gemini with the `RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT`, enables the Google Search tool (`types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())`), processes the response to extract the generated text and citation metadata, and formats it into a Markdown string with superscript citations and a reference list. Includes retry logic for robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it solves the problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **üò¨ Lack of Realistic Simulation:** `encode64_pil_image` and the image handling in `get_interview_transcript` (using `DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT`) enable the use of a visual whiteboard, a common element in real interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Subjective/Delayed Feedback:** `get_interview_transcript` creates a comprehensive log of the interaction (including visual descriptions) for the evaluation model, leading to more data-driven, less subjective feedback. `get_learning_resources` delivers immediate, actionable learning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **üß≠ Difficulty Identifying Weaknesses:** `get_data_for_search` extracts the identified weaknesses to feed into the learning plan generator. `get_learning_resources` uses grounding to provide highly relevant resources specifically tailored to these weaknesses."

    "## ‚ú® 5. Showcasing GenAI Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explicitly demonstrates several powerful Generative AI features available through the Gemini API and LangChain/LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Function Calling:** The interviewer agent uses tools (`list_questions`, `select_question`, `get_random_problem`, `end_interview`, etc.) defined with the `@tool` decorator. The LLM (`llm_with_tools`) decides when to call these functions based on the conversation and system prompt, generating the required arguments. This allows the agent to interact with the external question database and control the interview flow (e.g., ending the interview). The `ToolNode` and custom tool nodes handle the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Structured Output:** The `create_report_node` leverages Gemini's ability to generate JSON output conforming to a predefined schema. By defining Pydantic models (`EvaluationOutput`, etc.) and specifying them in the `generate_content` call (`response_schema`), we ensure the evaluation report is consistently structured, making it easy to parse and format using the Jinja2 template (`REPORT_TEMPLATE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Few-Shot Learning:** The `INTERVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` includes explicit examples of interactions (e.g., how to provide hints, how to respond to whiteboard input). This provides the LLM with concrete examples of the desired behavior, improving its ability to follow instructions and adopt the correct persona and interaction style.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Image Understanding (Multimodality):** The application accepts whiteboard sketches via the Gradio `Sketchpad`. The `chat_interface_update` function encodes the PIL image to base64. The `get_interview_transcript` function then incorporates this image data when creating the full transcript passed to the evaluation model. It uses a Gemini Vision model via `DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT` to generate a textual description of the image, integrating visual information into the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Agents (LangGraph):** The entire interviewer is built as a stateful agent using LangGraph. It maintains the conversation state (`InterviewState`), transitions between different processing steps (nodes like `chatbot`, `tools`, `create_report`), and makes decisions based on LLM outputs and tool results (conditional edges via `maybe_route_to_tools`). This enables the complex, multi-turn, and tool-using behavior required for the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Long Context Window:** The agent handles potentially long interview conversations. The `InterviewState` accumulates all messages. The `get_interview_transcript` function processes this entire history, and the `create_report_node` passes the full transcript to the evaluation model, allowing it to consider the entire interaction when generating the assessment. Gemini's long context capabilities are essential here.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Grounding (Gemini with Google Search):** The `get_learning_resources` function implements grounding. It calls Gemini with a specific prompt (`RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT`) and enables the `GoogleSearch` tool. Gemini uses search results to generate a *grounded* learning plan based on the evaluation feedback and identified topics, ensuring the recommendations are relevant and based on real-world information. The system automatically handles citations for the sources used."

    "### Conclusion \n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates the creation of a sophisticated, AI-powered Mock Technical Interviewer using Google Gemini and LangGraph. By integrating features like stateful agentic behavior, function calling, structured output, multimodal input (text, code, image), and grounded recommendations, it provides a valuable and interactive tool for developers preparing for technical interviews. The detailed evaluation report and personalized learning plan offer actionable feedback to help users identify strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Future Work\n",
    "*   **More Question Types:** Expand the `data.json` to include system design, behavioral questions, or questions for different roles/levels.\n",
    "*   **Voice Interaction:** Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech for a more natural conversational experience.\n",
    "*   **Code Execution & Testing:** Allow the agent to actually run the candidate's code against test cases and provide feedback on correctness and performance.\n",
    "*   **More Sophisticated Evaluation:** Fine-tune the evaluation prompt or use multiple LLM calls for deeper analysis of specific aspects (e.g., code quality metrics, complexity analysis).\n",
    "*   **Persistence:** Allow users to save and resume interview sessions.\n",
    "*   **Different Interviewer Personas:** Offer options for different interviewer styles (e.g., more challenging, more collaborative).\n",
